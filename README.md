# Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) Final Year Project

## Overview

This project focuses on the application of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) principles to design and implement three distinct user interfaces (UIs): a shopping website, an inventory management system, and a notes application. Each UI is tailored to meet specific user needs, emphasizing usability, accessibility, and user satisfaction. The project demonstrates the practical application of a range of different HCI methodologies and principles, highlighting the integration of HCI theory and practice in software development.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into a main folder containing three sub-folders, each dedicated to one of the UI projects:

- `Shopping Website/` - Contains all files and resources related to the shopping website UI, designed for accessibility and usability, particularly for users with visual impairments.
- `ReactInterface/` - Houses the inventory management system UI, aimed at business owners needing a streamlined method for maintaining inventory.
- `Notes/` - Includes the notes application UI, developed for students to facilitate efficient note-taking and organization.

## Getting Started

To explore each UI project:

1. Navigate to the corresponding sub-folder.
2. Refer to the `README.md` file within each folder for detailed instructions on setup, usage, and additional information specific to that UI.

## Software Requirements

- Java (for the NotesApplication)
- HTML/CSS/JS 
- React (for the Inventory Management System)
- Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.)

## Installation

Clone the project repository to your local machine
Navigate into each project sub-folder and follow the installation instructions provided in the individual `README.md` files.

## Usage

Each sub-folder contains a separate UI project. To use any UI, navigate to its folder and follow the specific instructions detailed in its `README.md`.

## Acknowledgements

- Special thanks to Emma Lieu, supervisor, for guidance and support throughout the project.
- References to HCI literature and resources have significantly influenced the design and implementation of the UIs.
